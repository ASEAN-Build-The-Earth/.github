  Team ASEAN is a unified team which consists of countries that are from the South East Asia region. 
We will oversee the progression of Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Vietnam, Philippines, Brunei, Myanmar, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos and Timor-Leste throughout the building process.


### What is ASEAN? 
ASEAN is an organization called Assosiation of Southeast Asian Nation that gathers all South East Asian countries to make a unified system for the good of all participating countries. Like the ones in real life, we are aiming to do the same with Build The Earth.
